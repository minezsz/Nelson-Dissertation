Question:
1. Difference between dual genotyping vs single region genotyping. why does the study uses dual genotyping?
By analyzing two distinct genomic regions, dual genotyping provides a more detailed genetic profile of the virus, enhancing strain differentiation and evolutionary analysis. This can lead to more accurate tracking of transmission routes and understanding of outbreak dynamics.

2. One step vs two step pcr.. why does the study use 1 step pcr and when do we know which one to use?

3. dual genotyping related to ONT? coz we're looking at 2 things, its cheaper to use ONT coz we can get both things at the same time?
