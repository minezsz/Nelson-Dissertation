*Accenture helped implement the service that enables citizens to dial 1746 to report problems, such as potholes on streets and sidewalks, broken street lights, clearing sewer grates and water tunnels to prevent dengue fever and other health-related inspections. https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2012/accenture-helps-1746-in-rio-de-janeiro-celebrate-successful-first-year
*Accenture awarded hackathon team for developing a prototype for an early warning system to detect and prevent outbreaks of Dengue Fever and other vector-borne diseases. https://theedgemalaysia.com/article/singapore-team-wins-accentures-first-globallylinked-hackathon


Nuritas:
- Applies artificial intelligence to omics data for peptide discovery
- Focus on identifying plant-based peptides with potential health benefits or applications in food and agriculture
- Nuritas' AI platform, combined with DNA analysis, predicts, unlocks, and validates the efficacy of these peptides





Question:
1. Difference between dual genotyping vs single region genotyping. why does the study uses dual genotyping?
By analyzing two distinct genomic regions, dual genotyping provides a more detailed genetic profile of the virus, enhancing strain differentiation and evolutionary analysis. This can lead to more accurate tracking of transmission routes and understanding of outbreak dynamics.

2. One step vs two step pcr.. why does the study use 1 step pcr and when do we know which one to use?

3. dual genotyping related to ONT? coz we're looking at 2 things, its cheaper to use ONT coz we can get both things at the same time?







- Dengue mapping: Identifying where antibodies bind to the virus by growing the virus with antibodies until an escape mutant emerges for sequencing
- Dengue symptoms: Most infections result in mild fever; some cases are asymptomatic. Severe symptoms can lead to hemorrhagic fever, organ failure, and sometimes death
- Severe dengue: About 5% of cases, depending on location, can lead to severe vascular leakage, known as dengue hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome, which requires medical intervention
- Primary vs. Secondary infection: Severe infections are more likely in secondary infections due to different dengue virus serotypes; antibodies from a primary infection can enhance disease severity in a secondary infection
- Immune response: The immune system's role is significant in the pathogenesis of severe dengue, potentially leading to vascular leakage
- *Mast cell involvement: Mast cells which are known for their role in allergic reactions, are implicated in dengue pathogenesis and associated with vascular leakage
