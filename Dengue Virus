Dengue Virus - DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4

Background / Detail:
- Infection with one serotype provides lifelong immunity only against that specific serotype
- A person can potentially be infected four times, once with each serotype
- Outbreaks in Italy and France (2023)
- Caused by Aedes albopictus (Asian tiger mosquito), can be found in France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, and Türkiye. Has been introduced to Netherlands and Scandinavia, with observations in Sweden

Current effort: 
- Current global efforts to combat dengue outbreaks include introducing mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia, a bacterium that prevents the insect from transmitting viruses. The approach yielded promising results when tested on Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and three cities in Colombia. But because the A. albopictus mosquito naturally carries two strains of Wolbachia, the situation is more challenging.

Things to consider:
- Sporadic and seasonal disease in EU. Mosquitoes thrive in temperatures between 15 °C and 35 °C.
- Prevalence of asymptomatic dengue infections was 59.26%, with 65.52% during outbreaks and 30.78% during non-outbreak periods.

Notes:
- The virus can be detected using RT-PCR or NS1 antigen tests within the first week after the onset of symptoms.
