Dengue Virus - DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4

Background / Detail:
- Infection with one serotype provides lifelong immunity only against that specific serotype
- A person can potentially be infected four times, once with each serotype
- Outbreaks in Italy and France (2023)
- Caused by Aedes albopictus (Asian tiger mosquito), can be found in France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, and Türkiye. Has been introduced to Netherlands and Scandinavia, with observations in Sweden

Current effort: 
- Current global efforts to combat dengue outbreaks include introducing mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia, a bacterium that prevents the insect from transmitting viruses. The approach yielded promising results when tested on Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and three cities in Colombia. But because the A. albopictus mosquito naturally carries two strains of Wolbachia, the situation is more challenging.

Things to consider:
- Sporadic and seasonal disease in EU. Mosquitoes thrive in temperatures between 15 °C and 35 °C.
- Prevalence of asymptomatic dengue infections was 59.26%, with 65.52% during outbreaks and 30.78% during non-outbreak periods.

Existing diagnostic assays:
- Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs)
- NS1 Antigen Test
- Serological Tests
- Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT)

TWiV 633: Singapore viral Podcast:
- Dengue mapping: Identifying where antibodies bind to the virus by growing the virus with antibodies until an escape mutant emerges for sequencing
- Dengue symptoms: Most infections result in mild fever; some cases are asymptomatic. Severe symptoms can lead to hemorrhagic fever, organ failure, and sometimes death
- Severe dengue: About 5% of cases, depending on location, can lead to severe vascular leakage, known as dengue hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome, which requires medical intervention
- Primary vs. Secondary infection: Severe infections are more likely in secondary infections due to different dengue virus serotypes; antibodies from a primary infection can enhance disease severity in a secondary infection
- Immune response: The immune system's role is significant in the pathogenesis of severe dengue, potentially leading to vascular leakage
- *Mast cell involvement: Mast cells which are known for their role in allergic reactions, are implicated in dengue pathogenesis and associated with vascular leakage



DengueSeq Protocol:
Serotype Specific 
Pros:
- Offers detailed insights into the genetic characteristics and mutations of a specific serotype
- Good for targeted research and specific epidemiological tracking
Cons:
- Might miss broader genomic variations across different serotypes
- Might limit effectiveness in comprehensive surveillance

Universal Pan-Serotype
Pros:
- Enable the detection and analysis of all serotypes within a single assay
- Beneficial for broad surveillance purposes, understanding cross-serotype interactions, and monitoring genetic shifts among the virus population
Cons:
- Potentially lower specificity for individual serotypes and possibly higher complexity and cost

From the protocols mentioned in "DengueSeq: A pan-serotype whole genome amplicon sequencing protocol for dengue virus V.2", both methods seem to output an identical result. 


Question:
1. The protocol mentioned sequencing the dengue viruses using Illumina. Would ONT yield the same result in terms of % genome coverage and in terms of specific vs. universal pan serotype results?
2. The following statement was made: "We used the serotype-specific assay to sequence undiluted virus stocks. We found that all genotypes within each serotype had high coverage, except for sylvatic dengue virus serotype 2 (genotype VI)". Is this due to mismatches in the primer or probe sequences, which resulted in lower sensitivity?
3. I have a question about the chart in the "code_to_genomes wk2 quality control" slide. Is there a direct relationship between the quality of the sequenced sample and a higher percentage of coverage X20? Or does a high percentage of quantity not necessarily indicate a high percentage of quality?
